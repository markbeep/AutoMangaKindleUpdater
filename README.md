Not tested to work on different devices yet. Can barely get it to work on mine.

If some error about kindlegen is showing up, just throw the `kindlegen.exe` into the root directory of this program or add kindlegen to your PATH: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/issues/363#issuecomment-684794354

Problems:
- If the book is supposably being sent to the kindle, but it never arrives, make sure you added your email as a confirmed mail on Amazon.

# Installing
To install, simply clone to your folder using `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:markbeep/AutoMangaKindleUpdater.git` so that the requried submodules are also installed.
